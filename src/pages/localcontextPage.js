        <h1>The Kalang Headwaters</h1>
        <p>The mature native forests of the Kalang Headwaters provide a safety and buffer zone to old growth trees and rain forested areas at the headwaters of the Kalang River and its tributaries, filtration to the river system, as well as habitat for a myriad of threatened and endangered flora and fauna.  This land is Gumbaynggirr Nation Country and important to maintaining their cultural heritage.</p>
        <p>Logging in this steep fragile environment with a high annual rainfall will inevitably, as it has historically, result in heavy run off and sedimentation of the pristine Roses Creek and the Kalang River. This increased turbidity and associated sedimentation reduces water flows through siltation and smothers aquatic flora and fauna. </p>
        <p>Environment groups, community members, businesses and the residents of the Kalang valley, some of whom rely on the river’s clean water for drinking, cooking and the watering of organic crops and stock are united in their goal to have these areas so vital to preserving a healthy water supply protected from an inevitable damage.</p>
        <p> In 1992 a Department of Land and Water Conservation (DLWC) report found the Forestry Commission and its contractors had repeatedly breached soil-erosion control guidelines, creating several major landslips on Catbird Road in Oakes State Forest. DLWC estimated that over 88,000 tonnes of soil had been mobilised towards the headwaters of the Bellinger River near Mt Killiekrankie on the NSW Mid North Coast.  In places, whole sections of land and vegetation moved en masse as the foundation rocks sheared. The river’s tributary creeks down slope of road works and logging operations were choked with spoil and rubble six feet deep in places. Downstream the creeks ran red with sediments. Evidence of this is still visible today. The steep terrain of the proposed logging operation in Oakes and Roses Creek SF, is again setting the scene for another possible mass erosion event.</p>
        <p>Forestry Corporation is now able to log on steeper slopes, and buffer zones to fourth order streams ha to get to the big, old trees so vital to our threatened species. Extensive forests of big trees are the seed banks for making rain and we need greater protection for our waterways, not less.</p>
        <p>Any logging in the proposed Headwaters Conservation Reserve (Buckra Bendinni, Rose’s Creek, Scotchman Oakes and Die Happy State Forests) is inconsistent with the protection and conservation of forest values including, water quality and quantity, biodiversity, ecosystem services and carbon storage required by the Bellingen community. We therefore call on the NSW Government to permanently end logging immediately and create the Headwaters Conservation Reserve protect the headwaters and tributaries of the Kalang, Bellinger and Nambucca Rivers in perpetuity.</p>
        <p>The community ran a successful camp in the Kalang State forests (biodiversity Embassy) for 4 months until the November closure of public forests due to the risk of fires.  This camp stopped logging in the headwaters and drew attention of the issue to the broader community, and is now reopening. Morning vigils have continued throughout this period.  Vigil, and camp, have helped to provide a visible presence, met incoming vehicles and explained the concerns of the community.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive reserve proposal has been prepared and submitted to the Minister. This proposal is supported in principle by Bellingen Shire council. The Friends of Kalang Headwaters (FOKH) has weekly meetings and is made up of individuals and alliances with Kalang River and Forest Alliance, Bellingen Environment Centre Inc and National Parks Association.  This Strategic Plan is formulated to direct and prioritise FOKH’s actions.  As such FOKH recognises that there are many others within the Bellingen, and the wider communities, that are working as individuals to stop the proposed logging of the Kalang Headwaters and are grateful for their continual efforts.  </p>
        <h1>The 2019/2020 Bushfires.</h1>
        <p>The spring and summer of 2019 and 2020 saw an unprecedented fire season.  In the worst-hit state, New South Wales fire affected more than five million hectares, destroying more than 3,000 houses and forcing thousands to seek shelter elsewhere. Twenty-eight people lost their lives (as of 19.1.2020) the fires have claimed at least one billion animals, according to University of Sydney environmental sciences professor Chris Dickman.  The most affected vegetation was heath land, with more than half affected by fire.  Then this was followed by wet sclerophyll forests with more than 40 per cent burnt. Of the 300 fauna species listed as “threatened” under the NSW Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016, the habitat of 60 were affected by these fires.</p>
        <p>Most of the animals that escaped the unprecedented crisis will eventually perish. “Even the animals that haven’t immediately been killed from the fires and the smoke, most of those that are displaced will eventually die,” Professor Martine Maron said. “The problem is there aren’t a lot of unburnt refuges through these areas, and of course, where there are unburnt areas of habitat, there are already other animals there using it.”</p>
        <p>It is the position of the FOKH that the permanent protection of the globally significant forests of the Headwaters Conservation Reserve from logging becomes a priority for the NSW Government and this Strategic Plan is developed to achieve this end. </p>
        <p>In November 2019, the Environmental Protection Agency revoked the licences allowing the logging of Oakes, Scotchman and Roses Creek SF; FCNSW must resubmit a new application, and demonstrate community consultation. FKH is expecting efforts to recommence logging any day.</p>

        <h1>Political and policy context (NSW and Commonwealth)</h1>
        <p>As part of their new Integrated Forestry Operations Approval (IFOA) the NSW Government is proposing to subject mapped old growth forest and rainforest protected for the past 20 years to a review process that is intended to <a href="https://www.nefa.org.au/oldgrowth_and_rainforest_campaign">make over 100,000ha of old growth forests</a> and rainforests on State Forests available for logging.</p>
        <p>The NSW Government has stated that its <a href="https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/711851/nsw-forestry-industry-roadmap.pdf">planted and native forestry estate</a> should be managed in line with the principles of Ecologically Sustainable Forest Management, and the NSW Government commitments under current and future Regional Forest Agreements and Wood Supply Agreements.</p>
        <p>The current state Labor opposition has stated it would expand national parks to protect koalas and included the Great Koala National Park as an election pledge in the last two state elections.</p>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/publications/national-koala-conservation-mgt-strategy-2009-2014">Commonwealth Governments strategy for Koala expired in 2014</a>. There has been significant community consultation since 2013 but no plan/strategy has been released as a result of this.</p>
        <p>State and Territory governments have primary responsibility for forest management, including public and private forests. This is in recognition of the constitutional responsibility of the States for land use decisions and their ownership of large areas of forests. The Commonwealth Government’s direct involvement in forests is limited largely to the approval of woodchip export licences. Responsibility for this lies with the Minister for Resources. </p>
        <p>Federal Labor continues to support Regional Forest Agreements, if they are based on the best available science as it applies to the proper consideration of social, economic and environmental factors. Sadly, the RFAs have entrenched logging in our native forests.</p>
        <p><a href="https://greens.org.au/nsw/policies/forests">NSW Greens would Implement a prohibition on the logging</a> and clearing of all native forests, rainforest, multi-aged and old growth forest, high conservation value areas and timbered crown lands.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://greens.org.au/policies/natural-resources-forests-and-mining">Australian Greens state</a> that they would implement immediate protection of all old-growth and high conservation value forests.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.audit.nsw.gov.au/our-work/reports/managing-native-vegetation">The NSW Government’s Auditor concluded that the clearing of native vegetation</a> on rural land is not effectively regulated and managed because the processes in place to support the regulatory framework are weak. There is no evidence-based assurance that clearing of native vegetation is being carried out in accordance with approvals. Responses to incidents of unlawful clearing are slow, with few tangible outcomes. Enforcement action is rarely taken against landholders who unlawfully clear native vegetation. There are processes in place for approving land clearing but there is limited follow-up to ensure approvals are complied with.</p>
        <p>NSW log production in 2017–18 continued to increase up by 224,000 cubic metres (page 6) or 4% year-on-year with softwood production up 1% year-on-year to 4.99 million cubic metres and hardwood production up 20% year-on-year to 1.23 million cubic metres. Hardwood production accounted for just 20% of production by volume, and came from both native forests (24%) and plantation forests (76%), from which 977,000 and 254,000 cubic metres of logs respectively were harvested.</p>

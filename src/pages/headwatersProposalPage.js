      <h2>ORIGIN AND INTENT OF THIS RESERVE PROPOSAL</h2>
      <p>
        The reserve proposal encompassing the forests of the Upper Kalang,
        Middle Bellinger and Nambucca Rivers are public land. The Friends of the
        Kalang Headwaters (FoKH) have commissioned this proposal to ensure
        permanent protection of these forests within a formal conservation
        reserve, particularly for ensuring water security at a time of
        unprecedented water shortage. FoKH is an affiliation of environmental
        and business organisations, and has joined with concerned members of the
        local community to form a coordinated effort to protect, promote and
        preserve the natural and cultural values of the forests in this reserve
        proposal, and to seek their immediate, permanent protection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intensive expert ecologist-led and community biodiversity assessment
        work has been focused within Scotchman State Forest (compartments
        125&126) and Roses Creek State Forest (compartments 127&128). This has
        resulted in a significant number of new records of key threatened flora
        and fauna species, major range extensions and a great improvement in the
        understanding of the distribution and abundance of many species within
        this part of the public forest estate. These results are likely to be
        replicated, or potentially improved upon, with equivalent survey effort
        in other compartments and State Forests across the proposed reserve.
        High intensity Biodiversity Assessment results from Compartments 125-128
        highlight the national conservation values within these forests;
        reservation is compatible with the maintenance of these values.
      </p>
      <p>
        From discussions with traditional custodians and representatives of the
        Gumbaynggirr Nation it is apparent that there are many cultural values
        across the proposed reserve, these values will be best maintained with
        the cooperative and protective management strategies of a conservation
        reserve.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reserve proposal encompasses the entirety of the Upper Kalang River
        headwaters, the Bellinger River catchment and part of the Nambucca River
        catchment. Within this reserve proposal is all of Buckrabendinni, Roses
        Creek and Oakes State Forests and part of Diehappy, Irishman and
        Scotchman State Forests.
      </p>
      <h2>STATEMENT OF VALUES AND SIGNIFICANCE</h2>
      <p>
        The proposal covers 13,233 ha of public land that provides connectivity
        between the New England and Dorrigo National Parks Gondwana World
        Heritage properties as well as connecting these reserves with both
        Baalijin and Juugawaarri Nature Reserve and Gumbaynggirr National Park
        and State Conservation Area. This proposed reserve contains extensive
        areas of nationally significant intact and inter-connected tall wet
        sclerophyll forests at low to mid elevation. These forests are
        interspersed with subtropical rainforest communities and contain
        extensive areas of old growth forest. These ecosystems are in excellent
        condition, mostly lacking environmental weeds and feral animals, and
        support intact and functional populations of threatened apex predators
        such as the Spotted-tailed Quoll (Dasyurus maculatus) and Powerful Owl
        (Ninox strenua)and other threatened species, such as the Long-nosed
        Potoroo (Potorous tridactylus), that are responsible for keystone
        ecosystem health functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is strong and emerging evidence of the antiquity and stability of
        aquatic ecosystems in the Bellinger Valley, with many specific elements
        of these ecosystems representing amongst the oldest and most stable
        freshwater ecosystems on the planet. These aquatic ecosystems supply
        residents of Urunga and Bellingen with their drinking water supply and
        for future water security every effort must be expended to ensure the
        continued availability of adequate flows of clean water from the
        headwaters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aquatic ecosystems in drainage lines within and adjoining this reserve
        proposal in the Upper Bellinger Valley are known to support remnant
        populations of the Critically Endangered Bellinger River Snapping
        Turtle, Myuchelys georgesii; this species in considered amongst the most
        ancient of known chelid turtles. Genetic dating work for this species
        has indicated an evolutionary age of approximately 80 million years, a
        lineage considerably pre-dating the extinction of the dinosaurs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The forests of the proposed reserve represent core habitat for a great
        diversity of threatened and declining forest fauna species, notably
        supporting a nationally significant interconnected breeding population
        of Koalas, many hollow-dependent and ancient threatened species and
        large complexes of the Lowland Subtropical Rainforest threatened
        ecological community, protected under the Commonwealth Environment
        Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) Car Reserve
        System and JANIS Criteria. Collectively these forests comprise a key
        component of a core Gondwanan refuge that is of critical significance
        for the survival of ancient ecosystems and species such as the Rufous
        Scrub-bird (Atrichornis rufescens), Sphagnum Frog (Philoria sphagnicolus
        ), Stuttering Frog (Mixophyes balbus) and the many species of passerine
        birds inhabiting these forests (such as the Superb Lyrebird (Menura
        novaehollandiae) and the Southern Logrunner (Orthonyx temminckii) that
        are known to represent the most primitive and basal lineages of all
        passerines.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reserve proposal covers a significant and unique section of both the
        Great Escarpment and the adjoining Great Eastern Ranges forests. The
        Great Escarpment in the hinterland of Bellingen andBowraville broadly
        follows the Horseshoe Road and is a key element of this
        continental-scale wildlife corridor. Beyond the proposed reserve,
        elevation extends to in excess of 1500m above sea level, meaning that
        the reserve is a key component of the shortest (and in many parts the
        steepest) intact gradient of native vegetation connecting habitats from
        sea level to the subalpine ecosystems on the continent. Management of
        this entire landscape has important implications for the globally
        significant assemblage of biodiversity known to be dependent upon it.
        Industrial logging of these forests is simply not compatible with
        maintenance and the future viability of this astonishing natural
        heritage legacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of the high level of ecosystem intactness and the very broad
        connectivity of the forests of the proposed reserve, many of the
        threatened fauna species known to occupy these forests are able to
        migrate broadly. This enables long-distance genetic exchange and
        interbreeding, thereby supporting genetically diverse large and viable
        populations of species that have become extinct across much of their
        historic range (e.g. Koala, Rufous Scrub-bird, Greater Glider and
        Long-nosed Potoroo). If allowed to continue to structurally develop,
        following extractive forest management 30-50 years previously, these
        forests will have improved capacity to support many sensitive and
        threatened species; this is particularly the case for hollow-dependent
        threatened fauna species.
      </p>
      <h2>WATER RESOURCE VALUES AND WATER SECURITY</h2>
      <p>
        With widespread extreme and record drought conditions now afflicting
        much of the eastern seaboard of Australia, many rivers that have never
        ceased flowing in recorded history have now stopped flowing. Because of
        the extensive forest cover in their headwaters the Bellinger and Kalang
        Rivers are still flowing cool and clean, despite historically low
        rainfall in recent years. The retention of all forest cover in these
        catchments must be a priority to ensure water security for the residents
        of the Bellingen and Nambucca Shires and for the viability of
        agricultural, fishing and tourism industries.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a substantial body of evidence globally that forests create
        rainfall as well as moderating climatic extremes. Maintenance and
        enhancement of forest cover across the Bellinger, Kalang andNambucca
        River Headwaters will be important for the maintenance of rainfall in
        the region and for the moderation and reduction of climatic extremes
        happening as a consequence of global climate heating. There are good
        prospects for retention of water and maintenance of stream flows in the
        Bellinger, Kalang and Nambucca Rivers into the future if all the
        headwater forests are protected.
      </p>
      <h2>CARBON STORAGE VALUES</h2>
      <p>
        The forests within the proposed Headwaters reserve are a diverse mixture
        of tall rainforest and eucalypt dominated forest communities with a high
        biomass, occurring within a high rainfall landscape with a stable and
        moist microclimate. Although the soils and parent rocks underlying most
        of the proposed reserve are relatively infertile, the primary
        productivity of these forests is high, resulting in large existing
        volumes of stored carbon and a very high potential for significant
        additional carbon storage as these forests regenerate and structurally
        mature after selective logging 30-50 years previously. If protected
        these forests will continue to structurally develop over the decades and
        centuries to come and will draw down and store atmospheric carbon.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is an excellent opportunity to allow these forests to continue to
        structurally develop and to build biomass. The processes of structural
        development occurring in these forests following historic logging (30-50
        years previously) create additional habitat resources for
        hollow-dependent species and for primitive Gondwanan species that are
        dependent upon a stable cool moist microclimate. As these forests
        structurally develop they increase in biomass, this enables the storage
        of greater volumes of water and provides a growing buffer against future
        droughts and heatwaves because of the known “air-conditioning” and
        cloud-seeding properties of these forests.
      </p>
      <h2>KOALA HABITAT VALUES</h2>
      <p>
        Native forests of the Upper Mid North Coast (Nambucca to Clarence
        Valley) are known to support a significant proportion of the population
        of the state population, there are some indications that 20% of the NSW
        Koala population resides in these forests. The headwaters of the
        Bellinger, Kalang and Nambucca Rivers are completely connected by forest
        cover, enabling the movement and interbreeding (and hence survival) of
        Koalas across the entire proposed reserve. Sections of the proposed
        Reserve are well-known Koala breeding hotspots and there are reliable
        indications of the occupation of healthy breeding Koalas across all
        sectors of the reserve proposal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Preliminary professional ecological and community-led Koala surveys have
        focused on Compartments 125-126 Scotchman State Forest and Compartments
        127-128 Roses Creek State Forest. Substantial evidence of Koalas has
        been gathered from across these four compartments including many direct
        observations of animals, substantial acoustic evidence, camera-trap
        evidence and the identification of feed trees spread across all four
        compartments from scat searches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Koala feed tree species and those occupied by Koalas that were
        documented during the surveys of compartments 125-128 include
        Tallowwood, Eucalyptus microcorys, New England Blackbutt, E.
        campanulata, Coastal Blackbutt, E. pilularis, White Mahogany, E.
        acmenoides, Forest Oak, Allocasuarina torulosa, Brush Box, Lophostemon
        confertus and Turpentine, Syncarpia glomulifera. A distinct feature of
        the forests across Compartments 125-128 is the near-complete absence of
        environmental weeds. Few weeds are present in low numbers. Weeds are
        mostly Lantana, Crofton Weed and Mistflower along roads and trails with
        very few apparent in core forest areas of these compartments. The
        general lack of weeds is a consequence of the lack of extractive forest
        management activities for 30-50 years and there has been negligible
        disturbances that have facilitated or enabled weed invasion. With a
        nationally significant Koala population there is a management priority
        to ensure that areas of habitat that are currently well utilised with a
        relatively open under storey remain free from Lantana, and that other
        weed-generating ground disturbances are avoided.
      </p>
      <p>
        A diversity and abundance of Koala feed trees are present in the
        complexes of wet and dry sclerophyll forest communities across the
        proposed reserve. Patches of rainforest vegetation within this forest
        matrix are cool moist refuges that Koalas move into during heatwave
        conditions, enabling their survival in such adverse climatic conditions.
      </p>
      <h2>
        POPULATIONS OF GREATER GLIDER AND LONG-NOSED POTOROO ACROSS COMPARTMENTS
        125-128
      </h2>
      <p>
        Expert ecologist and community spotlighting and camera-trap surveys in
        compartments 125&126 Scotchman State Forest and compartments 127&128 of
        Roses Creek State Forest have confirmed the presence of breeding
        populations of both the Greater Glider, Petauroides Volans and the
        Long-nosedmPotoroo, Potorous tridactylus within the boundaries of these
        localities.
      </p>
      <h2>CLIMATE</h2>
      <p>
        The climate is humid-subtropical with a peak in rainfall during late
        summer and autumn. Cyclonic and ex-cyclonic weather events and East
        Coast lows can deliver extremely high rainfall intensitiesand rainfall
        totals occasionally exceeding 1000mm per event. Temperatures rarely
        exceed 35C and winter frosts are common in low lying and exposed
        landscapes. Average annual rainfall across the proposed reserve varies
        from approx. 1300mm – over 2000mm per annum (Bureau of Meteorology
        data).
      </p>
      <h2>DRAINAGE, WATER USE AND WATER USERS</h2>
      <p>
        Three major river systems drain eastwards from the proposed reserve,
        from north to south, the Bellinger, Kalang and Nambucca Rivers. The
        Bellinger River is the largest catchment with the most extensive and
        diverse aquatic ecosystems within the proposed Reserve. With a much
        larger catchment area the Bellinger River also has a substantially
        greater volume of flow than either the Kalang or Nambucca Rivers. Part
        or all of the following sub-catchments are within the Bellinger River
        catchment section of the proposed Reserve: Angys, Clear, Cleavers,
        Diehappy and Fishers Creek.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sub-catchments of the Kalang River section of the proposed reserve
        include Middle Camp and RosesCreek on the northern boundary of the
        Kalang River catchment and Graces Creek flowing southwards into the
        Nambuca River. Sub-catchments within the Nambucca/Buckrabendinni section
        of the proposed Reserve include Argents, Gravelly, Stinging Tree and
        Sullivans Creeks and Bottle Gully.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Bellinger River catchment all municipal water supply, limited
        agricultural irrigation and substantial stock and domestic supply is
        derived from the main channel of the river; residents of Urunga and
        Bellingen are therefore critically reliant upon the maintenance of water
        quality and ofwater security (water quantity). In both the Kalang and
        Nambucca River catchments there are a range of water users including
        stock and domestic uses and agricultural irrigation.
      </p>
      <h2>ELEVATION AND TOPOGRAPHY</h2>
      <p>
        Elevation in the Bellinger River section of the proposed reserve ranges
        from approximately 80mnabove sea level (asl) along the main river
        channel at Orama, to 820m asl at the top of both Angys and Clear Creek
        sub-catchments. In the Kalang River catchment, elevation ranges from 80m
        asl along the Kalang River at Upper Kalang to 850m asl between Bellbucca
        and Owl Road and adjoining Hawk Road in the far west and southwest of
        the catchment. In the Nambucca River catchment elevation ranges from 90m
        asl along Gravelly Creek to 850m asl along Hawk Road in the far north of
        them catchment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The forests of the Bellinger, Kalang and Nambucca Valleys are unique in
        their steepness and vulnerability to erosion, structural failure and
        mass-movement, particularly during the frequent intense rainfall events
        that occur. The structural failings of the landscape are because of the
        dominance and weaknesses of the underlying Nambucca shale beds. In upper
        catchment areas there are few if any areas of gentle relief and many
        slopes across the proposed reserve are precipitously steep.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>LANDFORM AND LANDSCAPE</h2>
      <p>
        A significant proportion of the proposed reserve is the broadly arcing
        ridge upon which the Horseshoe Road is positioned. This arc of ridges
        separates the Bellinger Valley from the Kalang Valley and the Nambucca
        Valley as well as separating parts of the Kalang Valley from the
        Nambucca Valley. Across a large proportion of its length there are
        precipitous slopes either side of the Horseshoe Road, and headwater
        tributaries are all steep in the upper reaches and quickly reach their
        confluence with the major stream channels on the valley floor.
      </p>
      <h2>VEGETATION COMMUNITIES</h2>
      <p>
        The vegetation of the area varies from dry open forest on the exposed
        ridges to moist tall open forest on sheltered slopes to well-developed
        rainforest on sheltered creek flats and gullies. Forest Types are
        described in Research Note No. 17 (Forestry Commission of NSW 1989), as
        the descriptors of vegetation. Forest Types are a relatively simple
        classification of vegetation mainly based on commercial timber species.
        The Forest Type mapping maps just over half the area as Dry Blackbutt
        (FT 37), with Brush Box (FT 53) and Myrtle (FT 23) the only other types
        mapped on more than 10% of the area. A number of other Forest Types
        occupy smaller areas. There are other more ecologically based
        classifications of vegetation communities notably forest ecosystems,
        that are available.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the proposal area much of the area mapped as Dry Blackbutt (FT 37)
        would be better assigned to Moist Blackbutt (FT 36), and much of the
        area mapped as Myrtle (FT 23) is not a dry rainforest type and should be
        assigned to either Corkwood – Sassafras – Crabapple – Silver Sycamore
        (FT 3) or one of the warm temperate Forest Types.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following descriptions of the more extensive Forest Types are based
        on available site data from earlier surveys and unpublished field notes.
      </p>
      <h4>Dry Blackbutt (FT 37)</h4>
      <p>
        On dry ridges and exposed slopes an open to tall open forest dominated
        by Blackbutt Eucalyptus pilularis occurs. Other canopy species include
        New England Blackbutt E. campanulata, Tallowwood E. microcorys,
        Turpentine Syncarpia glomulifera, Diehard Stringybark E. cameronii and
        Broad-leaved White Mahogany E. carnea. There is often a small tree layer
        of Forest Oak Allocasuarina torulosa, Black Oak A. littoralis and
        Daviesia arborea. The ground layer includes small shrubs (such as
        Prickly Shaggy Pea Podolobium ulicifolium, Crinkle Bush Lomatia
        silaifolia and Beard Heath Leucopogon lanceolatus), as well as Bracken
        Fern Pteridium esculentum, Spiny-headed Matt-rush Lomandra longifolia
        and Wiry Panic Entolasia stricta.
      </p>
      <h4>Moist Blackbutt (FT 36)</h4>
      <p>
        This type is much more extensive than mapped by existing Forest Type
        mapping, particularly on steep sheltered slopes south of the Horseshoe
        Road. On more sheltered sites a moister tall open forest dominated by
        Blackbutt Eucalyptus pilularis occurs. Other canopy species include
        Tallowwood E. microcorys, Turpentine Syncarpia glomulifera, Brush Box
        Lophostemon confertus, White Mahogany E. acmenoides and Sydney Blue Gum
        E. saligna. The small tree and shrub layer includes Forest Oak
        Allocasuarina torulosa, Blackwood Acacia melanoxylon, Soft Corkwood
        Akama paniculosa, Rough Treefern Cyathea australis, Daviesia arborea and
        Rose Myrtle Archirhodomyrtus beckleri. Ground layer species include
        Gristle Fern Blechnum cartilaginium, Coopernookia chisolmii, Bracken
        Fern Pteridium esculentum, Soft Bracken Calochleana dubia and
        Spiny-headed Matt-rush Lomandra longifolia.
      </p>
      <h4>Brush Box (FT 53)</h4>
      <p>
        On sheltered lower slopes often adjacent to rainforest vegetation a
        moist tall open forest dominated by Brush Box Lophostemon confertus
        occurs. Other common canopy species include Sydney Blue Gum Eucalyptus
        saligna, Tallowwood E. microcorys and Blackbutt E. pilularis. There is
        usually a well-developed small tree layer of species such as Blackwood
        Acacia melanoxylon, Soft Corkwood Akama paniculata, Murrogun Cryptocarya
        microneura and Forest Oak Allocasuarina torulosa. Shrubs such as Rose
        Myrtle Archirhodomyrtus beckleri, Forest Maple Cryptocary rigida and
        Bolwarra Eupomatia laurina, and the vines Five-leaved Water Vine Cissus
        hypoglauca, Giant Water Vine Cissus antarctica and Austral Sarsaparilla
        Smilax australis are often present. The ground layer is generally sparse
        with Soft Bracken Caloclaena dubia and Native Ginger Alpinia caerulea
        the most frequent species.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Rainforest Communities (mapped as Myrtle (FT 23) and Corkwood –
        Sassafras – Crabapple – Silver Sycamore (FT 3))
      </h4>
      <p>
        On sheltered creek flats, particularly along the upper Kalang River, a
        well-developed subtropical rainforest occurs. This is dominated by large
        Yellow Carabeen Sloanea woollsii, Brush Box Lophostemon confertus and
        Strangling Fig Ficus watkinsiana with occasional emergent large mature
        Flooded Gum Eucalyptus grandis. Other tree species present include
        Coachwood Ceratopetalum apetalum, Red Carabeen Geissois benthamiana,
        White Beech Gmelina leichhardtii and Northern Acradenia Acradenia
        euodiiformis. Common midstorey species and shrub include Bangalow Palm
        Archontophoenix cunninghamiana, Prickly Tree Fern Cyathea leichardtiana
        and Featherwood Polyosma cunninghamii. The ground layer is generally
        sparse with Adiantum sylvaticum, Cyperus filipes and Strap Water Fern
        Blechnum patersonii present.
      </p>
      <p>
        At higher elevations, such as on the southern slope of Boot Hill are
        areas of warm temperate rainforest. Canopy species include a number of
        tree species such as Sassafras Doryphora sassafras, Black Booyong

        The narrower gullies and creeks contain less well developed examples and
        gradations between these two rainforest communities.

      <h4>New England Blackbutt (FT 163)</h4>
      <p>
        On higher altitude exposed ridges Blackbutt Eucalyptus pilularis tends
        to be replaced by New England Blackbutt E. campanulata. Mid and
        under-storey species are similar to those found in the Dry Blackbutt
        community.
